# Gitweb Toucanize Theme
* * *
## About

While working on a big personal project I started to feel the need for a SCM to better organize my work, so I installed Git/Gitweb on my local CentOS server, but couldn't really stand the default Gitweb theme. 

This is my attempt at creating a theme for Gitweb which is **usable and relaxing to look at**. My goal was to use only CSS to style the pages (the HTML generated by the CGI was not modified) and organize all the information provided by the interface in a much more **gerarchical and clean way**.

The name *toucanize* is derived from the project I was working on (called "Toucan CMS").

## Build

The repository contains a MSBuild file that creates the right output directory structure, merges and compress the CSS files and zip all the files in a single archive. Just run make.cmd (or make-debug.cmd if you don't want the files to be merged and compressed). 

The build file has been tested on the .Net Framework 4.0, but *may* work also on 3.5. Just change the path to MSBuild in make.cmd.

## Compatibility

The theme has been designed for **Gitweb 1.7.4.1** and tested on **Firefox 4, Opera 11.10, Internet Explorer 9 and Chrome 12**. All the tests were executed on a Windows 7 x64 box.

As the theme was created for personal use, older browsers will **not** be supported.

## Bugs

Some features still need some work. Refer to gitweb-toucanize.css for more information.
